# Managing Shared Cost

{% include contribute-capabiility.md %}

{% include domains-loop.md %}


## Definition
Managing shared cloud costs is the exercise of identifying and allocating cloud costs back to the teams or organizations that created them. Managing shared IT and cloud costs can spans multiple business departments. As organizations increase cloud resources and scale, it becomes increasingly difficult to assign shared cloud resources to specific business owners.

Without appropriately splitting costs that are shared, engineers and product managers lack a complete picture of how much their products are really costing.

Please see the ["Identifying Shared Cost" project](/projects/identifying-shared-costs/) for more information and context.

## Maturity Assessment
Shared costs can vary from organization to organization, and also depend on the maturity and size within the company itself. However, there are a standard set of costs that generally appear on every company’s balance sheet, and it becomes the responsibility of the company to determine whether they should be considered shared or not.

Some shared costs apply to the entire organization, while others may be shared only among those cost centers that use them. In terms of accounting however, most cases of “shared costs” in the cloud are actually accrued and charged within one account, and it can be challenging to determine which costs should be shared.

**TBD:** definitions of shared cost by FinOps maturity level-- contributions welcome!

## Functional Activity
Here are key personas that have expectations, activities, or stakeholdership in identifying and managing shared costs.

### Finance: Controlling
This person supports Executives to make better decisions. They typically want all costs accurately allocated according to cause and their respective cost centers where special attention is paid to shared costs.

### Business: Program Manager
This role is responsible for accurate reporting from all the products of their program that they manage. Not having shared costs distributed correctly could create a financial disadvantage for product budgets.

### Business: Product Owner Platform
This is a business owner of a shared platform which enables many product teams to deliver business value fast, reliable and secure. They have an obligation to showback or chargeback the costs that have been caused by the product teams by using their platform.

### Engineering: Software Engineer
This role typically operates workloads that create these costs but might be the last person to review or observe the charges.

### Engineering: Engineering Manager or Director
This leadership role is responsible for all costs incurred in their team or department, including the portion of shared costs that their team is charged.


## Measure(s) of Success
_at least one measure of success; should be described in a context of cost; this could be an efficiency KPI or an agreed upon threshold or target._
_for example:_
>* idle resource costs will not exceed 3% of total monthly cloud spend
* anomaly costs will not exceed $150/month



## Inputs
_the information used that contributes to the measure(s) of success listed above; information here may include specific datasources, reports or any relevant input_
