# Understanding Cloud Usage and Cost

Within this Domain, the organization will work to gather all required information about its cloud usage and cost, normalize it, make it available for review, including circulating it to those personas that will use it in other Domains.

The Capabilities within this Domain focus on understanding and allocating the cost and usage within the organization, and not on actioning it for a particular purpose.

This Domain enables an organization to understand what cloud services itâ€™s using, what is driving spend, and who owns that spending.  It provides key data consistently to support a picture of current cloud usage and a view into historical trends, at a level of granularity appropriate to the organization current maturity level to support the second Domain: Performance Tracking and Benchmarking.

At its core, this Domain answers the question: What are we spending on cloud and what are we using?
