# Performance Tracking & Benchmarking

Within this domain, the organization sets and maps its usage and cost to budgets, uses historical information to forecast, and establishes and measures KPIs and other performance indicators, including benchmarking.

This Domain entails the capabilities that look at our past and current spend, set baselines and budgets, and then forecast to help us understand if what we’re spending is expected, understood, and at a level that allows us to meet our organizational objectives.

At its core, this Domain answers the question: Does what we’re using/spending allow us to achieve our strategic and organizational objectives?
