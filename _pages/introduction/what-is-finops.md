## Cloud FinOps Definition

> FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice that enables organizations to get maximum business value by helping engineering, finance, technology and business teams to collaborate on data-driven spending decisions.

*(Updated definition adopted by the FinOps Foundation’s [Technical Advisory Council](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/tac){:target="_blank"} in November 2022)*

FinOps is a portmeanteau of “Finance” and “DevOps” sometimes called “Cloud Financial Management”, “Cloud Financial Engineering” “Cloud Cost Management”, “Cloud Optimization”, or “Cloud Financial Optimization”. Regardless of the synonym, it is the practice of bringing a financial accountability cultural change to the variable spend model of cloud, enabling distributed engineering and business teams to make trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality in their cloud architecture and investment decisions.

It is not done by a single person/team but rather changes the way that disparate teams work together in cloud.

The practice of FinOps is inherently iterative and maturity of any given process, functional activity, [Capability](/framework/capabilities/) or [Domain](/framework/domains/) will improve with repetition. Typically a “Crawl” stage organization is highly reactive and focused on addressing problems after they occur, while a Run stage practice is proactively factoring cost into their architecture design choices and ongoing engineering processes. 

A [“Crawl, Walk, Run” maturity approach](/framework/maturity-model/) to performing FinOps enables organizations to start small, and grow in scale, scope and complexity as business value warrants maturing a functional activity. Taking quick action at a small scale and limited scope allows FinOps teams to assess the outcomes of their actions, and to gain insights into the value of taking further action in a larger, faster, or more granular way.

No longer is a siloed procurement team identifying costs and signing off on them. Instead, a cross-functional FinOps team adopts a definitive series of procurement best practices, enabling them to pull together technology, business, and finance in order to optimize cloud vendor management, rate, and discounting. With FinOps, each engineering and operational team (e.g. workload, service, product owner) can access the near-real-time data they need to influence their spend and help them make intelligent decisions that ultimately result in efficient cloud costs balanced against the speed/performance and quality/availability of services.

**If it seems that FinOps is about saving money, then think again. FinOps is about making money.** Cloud spend can drive more revenue, signal customer base growth, enable more product and feature release velocity, or even help shut down a data center. FinOps is all about removing blockers; empowering engineering teams to deliver better features, apps, and migrations faster; and enabling a cross-functional conversation about where to invest and when. Sometimes a business will decide to tighten the belt; sometimes it’ll decide to invest more. But now teams know why they’re making those decisions.

FinOps ensures you get the most value out of every dollar spent in cloud. It enables a shift — a combination of systems, best practices and culture — to increase an organization’s ability to understand cloud costs and make business tradeoffs. 

In the same way that DevOps revolutionized development by breaking down silos and increasing agility, FinOps increases the business value of cloud by bringing together technology, business and finance professionals with a new set of processes.

## What are the core principles and stakeholders of Cloud Financial Management?

Individuals at every level and in every area of an organization can have a different role to play in the FinOps practice: Executives, Engineers, FinOps Practitioners, Operations, Finance and Procurement. [Read more about FinOps Personas.](/framework/personas/)

## FinOps Team Structures

The above diagram demonstrates how, for organizations operating on the FinOps model, a cross-functional team known as a Cloud Cost Center of Excellence (CCoE) interacts with the rest of the business to manage the cloud strategy, governance, and best practices that the rest of the organization can leverage to transform the business using the cloud.

## FinOps Requires a Cultural Shift
At its core, FinOps is a cultural practice. This operating model is the most efficient way for teams to manage their cloud costs. Using FinOps, teams can come together to deliver faster while gaining financial and operational control.

Distributed decision making coupled with the move to variable spending in cloud allows engineering teams to efficiently partner with finance and business teams to make informed decisions that drive continual optimization. FinOps processes enable these teams to operate at high velocity while improving the unit economics of cloud. This shift enables and empowers teams at the edge and allows team members in every part of the business to participate in the process of increasing efficiency, optimizing utilization and reducing spend.
