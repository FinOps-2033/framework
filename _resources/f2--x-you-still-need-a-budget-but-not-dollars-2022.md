title: FinOps X '22 - You still need a budget, but donâ€™t need to use dollars - Matt Tomlinson (Indeed)
description: At Indeed, we set Time is greater than Cost as a priority, so we are moving away from dollar-based budgeting to incentivize velocity. This has turned out to be incredibly useful in shifting the conversation away from the price of cloud resources (a huge variable) to the number of resources needed.
