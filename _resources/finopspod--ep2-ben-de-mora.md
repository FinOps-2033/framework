title: FinOpsPod, episode 02 Ben de Mora - The Chaos is to Be Embraced
description: Ben de Mora may be the newest staff member at the FinOps Foundation, but he is absolutely not new to the Foundation at all. Ben has been a FinOps Instructor for years and he shares his experiences teaching the FinOps Certified Practitioner course. The conversation goes in a number of different directions - architecture, sustainability, estimated cloud costs and banjo. As Ben reminds us, the chaos is to be embraced.
