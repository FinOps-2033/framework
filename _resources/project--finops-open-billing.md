# FinOps Open Billing Standard
*A technical specification to build and maintain an open standard for cloud billing data developed by the FinOps Foundation.*

## What is FinOps Open Billing?
FinOps Open Billing Standard is the FinOps Foundation community specification that establishes an open standard for cloud billing data. It specifies vendor-neutral, cross-cloud measures for key cost & usage dimensions and/or metrics. These measures and their derivations establish a baseline schema that enables cloud billing data to be surfaced in a common FinOps serviceable format.

## What problem are we trying to solve?
There is no standard for surfacing key cloud cost & usage measures across multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). This creates challenges for stakeholders when making decisions and quantifying the business value of cloud.

This specification will describe a consistent set of measures, describing their origins, and a prescribed approach for surfacing the corresponding billing data via a shared data schema that is serviceable across all CSP’s. This open-billing standard will be critical for the FinOps community, especially as more and more service providers continue to enter the market with their own billing data formats and measures.

## Why are we working on an open billing standard?
By defining a standard for surfacing key cloud cost & usage measures across multiple CSPs, this FinOps program and related Working Groups can better support the FinOps Foundation mission to create open standards and best practices for individuals that are managing the value of cloud.

A few guiding statements include:

* Billing data is confusing, and it's not anyone's fault
* Developiong consistency is billing data is key-- trust requires understanding
* Smart people don't always agree-- so, what are the correct metrics?

## How to get started with FinOps open billing?
Please review the Code of Conduct, Scoping document, Notices, and License file on the [project GitHub repo](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/finops-open-billing). Instructions for contributors are included in the Contributing.md file.

You can discuss this specification with other FinOps Foundation members on our [Community Slack channel for the FinOps Open Billing Standard](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/C045R6BPB2Q). If you aren't a member yet, [please join](https://www.finops.org/membership/)!

## Why is FinOps Open Billing Standard being developed as a Technical Specification rather than a Working Group?
In order for enterprises and other organizations to use this standard to create, ingest, or surface billing data in a common format, they must be able to rely upon the right to use the standard and any reference implementations under the terms of the license agreement. Establishing a Technical Specification and tracking the standard in GitHub as a separate project allows for consistent and precise tracking of contributors and contributions, allowing the project to ensure all intellectual property rights are tracked and recorded.

This formal approach is important to allow those who contribute their knowledge and those who use the standard are protected.

## How can I contribute to the FinOps Open Billing Standard project (especially if I don’t use Github normally)?
The Project will be developed using a “hybrid contribution” model, meaning that while changes may be made by contributors direction in GitHub, input will also be taken at meetings of the FinOps Open Billing Standard Working Group. This input will be entered into GitHub, which will remain the official record of the standard.

The contribution model is defined officially in the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/finops-open-billing/blob/main/Contributing.md) file in the project repository.

## Who developed the FinOps Open Billing Standard?
The FinOps Open Billing Standard specification and standards have been developed by the FinOps Foundation community with inspiration, guidance and resources from Joint Development Foundation, the Open Web Foundation agreements, the Alliance for Open Media Patent License 1.0, and the Linux Foundation.

Learn more on the [Project GitHub Repo](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/finops-open-billing).

## What is the schedule for development of the FinOps Open Billing Standard?

The FinOps Open Billing project is working toward the following schedule:
* Complete initial Scope, Contributing, Notice and License files - **12/16/22**
* Distribute Contributor agreements for signature (required by all contributors) - **12/16/22**
* Establish initial Steering Committee - **12/31/22**
* Finalize project scope and establish steering committee - **1/27/23**
* Public release of common specification - **3/21/23**

Discuss these milestones and more on our [Community Slack channel for the FinOps Open Billing Standard](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/C045R6BPB2Q).
