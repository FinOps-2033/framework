product-overview: |
  The Kyndryl FinOps solution is designed with the flexibility to meet you wherever you are on your journey to cloud and adoption of FinOps. We put emphasis on the importance of transparent visibility in creating awareness and driving the cultural transformation, and on the systemic changes needed to operationalize FinOps for the long term. We draw from our experience to encourage best practices, like building support early in the program through the adoption of the FinOps operating model with a pilot group of users in a common cost center—a pilot that both proves the business value and provides insight into the sustainability of the target operating model.

  Kyndryl works with you to build your FinOps capability.

  • We advise. We help you identify the current state of your FinOps maturity and where you need to be. We provide design and planning services to help you understand how to get to the desired state.

  • We implement. In an iterative fashion, we help deploy the systems and adopt FinOps processes and best practices into your enterprise.

  • We continuously improve. Once the FinOps model is defined and adopted, we continue to monitor and optimize the solution, ensuring that your organization is always getting maximum value.

  • We continuously operate. Depending on the requirements of your unique environment, we offer various levels for continuous operation of the FinOps operating model.
