  Liquid Reply supports their partners to embrace the ever-changing IT universe as a part of their own DNA. The team ensures full cloud native potential by providing a holistic approach to people, systems and multi as well as hybrid cloud strategies.

  The Liquid Reply FinOps expert team offers consulting and training to companies.

Consequently, it is used to develop a FinOps strategy, which is then implemented in collaboration between Liquid Reply and the customer. Through the FinOps implementation phase, Liquid provides ongoing training or coaching of the customer’s employees to further advance the FinOps culture and individual Best Practices.
