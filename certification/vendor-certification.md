## FinOps Certified Platform

A pre-qualified tier of vetted technology providers who offer software solutions to successfully adopt cloud financial management practices.

- Maps the open source FinOps capabilities to vendor tooling
- Although it does not make recommendations for platforms, the FinOps Foundation offers vendor specific forums – e.g., #finops-on-providerX in the FinOps Slack Blueprints of best practices – e.g., “how to FinOps on Provider X”


## FinOps Certified Service Provider


A pre-qualified tier of vetted service providers who have deep experience helping enterprises successfully adopt cloud financial management practices. The FCSP partners offer FinOps support, consulting, professional services and training for organizations embarking on their cloud financial management journey.

### Requirements
- Must have a dedicated FinOps or cloud financial management offering listed online
- Must have three or more FinOps Certified Practitioners
- Must have a business model to support enterprise end users
- Must be a FinOps Foundation and Linux Foundation member


## FinOps Training Partner
FinOps Foundation recognizes a select group of FinOps Training Partners (FTP). This is a tier of vetted training providers who have deep experience in cloud financial management training. 

### Requirements
- Ability to demonstrate your training capabilities by meeting strict benchmarks for experience and quality, including the ability to provide references from students who have completed your training courses and from major organizations that have used your training services.
- Are an existing FCSP, including deep knowledge of FinOps/CFM and involvement in the community.
- Reseller of the FOCP exam.
- Be an paid corporate Linux Foundation and FinOps Foundation vendor member
- Have a landing page that includes information on your CFM/FinOps training offering.
- If you are teaching instructor-led courses that also map to the FOCP exam, all instructors must pass the FOCP train-the-trainer program before teaching the course.


### Curriculum
If you are interested in creating your own FinOps training courses, FinOps Foundation has open sourced the [curriculum](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/curriculum) around which that exam has been created for the benefit of companies offering training.

If you don’t want to build you own course from scratch, the instructor-led version of FinOps Practitioner Training is already available and can be re-sold by Authorized Training Partners (ATP). FinOps Practitioner Training is updated frequently and already maps directly to the FOCP exam.

If you are interested in becoming an exam reseller, we also offer wholesale pricing on our exams to training companies purchasing in bulk.
