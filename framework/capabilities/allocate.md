# Allocate

## Introduction


## Contributing Functions

 * [Resource Metadata (Tagging/Labeling)](/framework/functions/tagging-labeling/)
 * [Resource Hierarchy (Accounts, Subscriptions & Projects)](/framework/functions/resource-hierarchy/)
 * [Shared Cost Management](/framework/functions/shared-cost-management/)


## Maturity Examples

How to get started and what great looks like.

 * Crawl = Costs allocated primarily by Resource Hierarchy
 * Walk = Resource Metadata providing fine grained cost allocation
 * Run = High levels of Resource Metadata coverage, shared resources have costs represented in Showback/Chargebacks.

## Common KPIs

 * Percentage of spend allocated by Resource Metadata/Hierarchy
 * Amount of spend allocated from shared resources
 * Percentage of unused shared resources
