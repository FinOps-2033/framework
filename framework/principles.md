# Principles

FinOps Principles give us north stars to guide our activities as we practice FinOps. Developed by FinOps Foundation members, honed through experience. These were initially proposed as part of the writing the Cloud FinOps book in Sept 2019 and agreed with AWS for announcement at CloudyCon. They may change slightly over time as experience is gained by all. 

The principles are in no particular order, they should be taken as a whole. Doing one without the others to excess creates problems the same as doing all except one

## Teams need to collaborate.
Finance moves at the speed and granularity of IT
Engineering considers cost as a new efficiency metric
Continuously improve for efficiency and innovation
Defined governance and controls for cloud usage

## Everyone takes ownership for their cloud usage.
Empower feature and product teams to manage their own usage of cloud against their budget
Visibility into cloud spend at all levels
Team-level targets and tracking to drive accountability

## A centralized team drives FinOps
Centrally govern and control Committed Use Discounts, Reserved Instances and Volume/Custom Discounts with Cloud Providers
Centralized discount buying process removes rate negotiations from engineering team consideration
Granular allocation of all costs, direct or shared, to the teams and cost centers responsible for them

## Reports should be accessible and timely.
Fast feedback loops result in more efficient behavior
Visibility helps determine if resources are under- or over-provisioned
Automation of resources drives continuous improvement

## Decisions are driven by business value of cloud.
Trending and variance analysis helps to understand why costs increased
Internal team benchmarking drives best practices and celebrates wins
Industry peer-level benchmarking determines how your company is performing

## Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud.
Rightsizing instances and services help drive appropriate resourcing levels
Comparing pricing between services and resource types drives better decisions
