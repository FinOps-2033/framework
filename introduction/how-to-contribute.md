# How to contribute
FinOps is gaining in popularity and is now a requirement at many large organizations, but it's also nascent and constantly growing and changing. This means that its best practices and principles will change over time as practitioners learn new skills, make new discoveries, and find new way to better operationalize cloud cost management.

We want to document these changes to best practices here, but we need your help.

## Make changes to the framework
One way to contribute is to commit changes to the FinOps Framework. If you see something that needs to be updated, augmented, or removed, we want to hear about it. This project is by the community and for the community and your voice matters.

Ways to submit changes:
* Make a commit using the GitHub GUI and submit it for review
* Create an issue that recommends a way to edit or fix something in the FinOps Framework that might need some help
* Report typos or broken links
* Add your own FinOps story to one of our challenge playbooks

## Review process

Changes to each respective section of this site will be reviewed during FinOps Foundation team meetings, or meetings with the Technical Advisory Council. During these council meetings, commits and Pull Requests will be reviewed and voted upon to be merged.

The FinOps Foundation team uses automation tools to rebuild the site multiple times a week to capture the latest changes or to make small updates to maintain the site.

Review cycles and timing
The FinOps Foundation's core operating members maintain the organization as a business. Its technical components, however, must be reviewed and voted upon by a greater group of community members. These meetings are scheduled throughout the month and the timeliness of reviewing commits and changes will vary depending on when these meetings occur.

Issues and small changes like link fixes and typos might occur immediately, as those don't require a significant amount of code review, voting, and/or approval.
